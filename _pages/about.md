I received the B.S. degree in electromagnetic wave propagation and antenna from Electronic Information School, [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/), Wuhan, Hubei, China, in 2015, and the Ph.D. degree in communication and information system from the Department of Space Microwave Remote Sensing Systems, Aerospace Information Research Institute, [Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://aircas.ac.cn/), Beijing, China, in 2021. From 2019 to 2020, I studied as a visiting Ph.D. student with the [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/en), Rome, Italy. In 2021, I joined the School of Computer and Information Engineering, [Henan University](https://www.henu.edu.cn/), Kaifeng, China. My research interests include synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging, orbital angular momentum, forward-looking radar imaging, and planetary and remote sensing.

# Research intresting

Currently, I am working in [Ning Li](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ning-Li-101)'s laboratory, conducting research related to [vortex electromagnetic wave radar (涡旋电磁波雷达)](https://gaofengshu.github.io/portfolio/vortex electromagnetic wave radar/), [SAR jamming and anti-jamming (SAR干扰与抗干扰)](https://gaofengshu.github.io/portfolio/SAR-jamming-and-anti-jamming/), , and planetary and remote sensing. I have published 13 papers as the first author or corresponding author, and 4 papers as a co-author.
