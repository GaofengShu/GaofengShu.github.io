I received the B.S. degree in electromagnetic wave propagation and antenna from Electronic Information School, [Wuhan University (武汉大学)](https://www.whu.edu.cn/), Wuhan, Hubei, China, in 2015, and the Ph.D. degree in communication and information system from the Department of Space Microwave Remote Sensing Systems, Aerospace Information Research Institute, [Chinese Academy of Sciences (中国科学院大学)](https://www.ucas.ac.cn/), Beijing, China, in 2021. From 2019 to 2020, I studied as a visiting Ph.D. student with the [Sapienza Università di Roma](https://www.uniroma1.it/en),” Rome, Italy. In 2021, I joined the School of Computer and Information Engineering, [Henan University (河南大学)](https://www.henu.edu.cn/), Kaifeng, China. My research interests include synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging, orbital angular momentum, forward-looking radar imaging, and planetary and remote sensing.

# Research intresting

Currently, I am working in [Ning Li](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ning-Li-101)'s laboratory, conducting research related to SAR jamming and anti-jamming, vortex electromagnetic wave radar, and planetary and remote sensing. I have published 13 papers as the first author or corresponding author, and 4 papers as a co-author. To view a complete list of my theses, please click on [publications](https://gaofengshu.github.io/publications/).

## SAR jamming and anti-jamming (SAR干扰与抗干扰)

**SAR jamming** technology is the act of polluting SAR images or creating deceptive scenes in SAR images through some technical means. **SAR anti-jamming** or **anti-interference** refers to designing a new radar system to prevent jamming signals from entering the receiver, or to remove jamming or interference signals from the received echo. Some publications are listed below.

## Vortex electromagnetic wave radar

**Vortex electromagnetic waves** are a type of electromagnetic wave that carries orbital angular momentum. These waves have spiral phase wavefronts and infinite modes, which can introduce new degrees of freedom to communication and microwave imaging. Some publications are listed below.

Shu** et al., "A Novel Vortex Synthetic Aperture Radar Imaging System: Decreasing the Pulse Repetition Frequency Without Increasing the Antenna Aperture," in *IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing*, vol. 60, pp. 1-14, 2022, Art no. 5203014, doi: [10.1109/TGRS.2021.3053650](https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2021.3053650).

## Planetary and remote sensing

Planetary and remote sensing employ remote sensing techniques to detect fundamental properties of a planet's surface or subsurface, such as surface elevation, roughness, and dielectric constant. These methods can also be used to map and date unique geological structures on the planet's surface. Some publications are listed below.
