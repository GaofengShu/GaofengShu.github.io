I received the B.S. degree in electromagnetic wave propagation and antenna from Electronic Information School, [Wuhan University (武汉大学)](https://www.whu.edu.cn/), Wuhan, Hubei, China, in 2015, and the Ph.D. degree in communication and information system from the Department of Space Microwave Remote Sensing Systems, Aerospace Information Research Institute, [Chinese Academy of Sciences (中国科学院大学)](https://www.ucas.ac.cn/), Beijing, China, in 2021. From 2019 to 2020, I studied as a visiting Ph.D. student with the [Sapienza Università di Roma](https://www.uniroma1.it/en),” Rome, Italy. In 2021, I joined the School of Computer and Information Engineering, [Henan University (河南大学)](https://www.henu.edu.cn/), Kaifeng, China. My research interests include synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging, orbital angular momentum, forward-looking radar imaging, and deep space exploration.

# Research intresting

Currently, I am working in [Ning Li](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ning-Li-101)'s laboratory, conducting research related to SAR jamming and anti-jamming, vortex electromagnetic wave radar, and deep space exploration.

## SAR jamming and anti-jamming (SAR干扰与抗干扰)

**SAR jamming** technology is the act of polluting SAR images or creating deceptive scenes in SAR images through some technical means. **SAR anti-jamming** or **anti-interference** refers to designing a new radar system to prevent jamming signals from entering the receiver, or to remove jamming or interference signals from the received echo. Some publications are listed below.
