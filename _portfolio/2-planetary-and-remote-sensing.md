**Planetary and remote sensing** employ remote sensing techniques to detect fundamental properties of a planet's surface or subsurface, such as surface elevation, roughness, and dielectric constant. These methods can also be used to map and date unique geological structures on the planet's surface. Some publications are listed below.
