**SAR jamming** technology is the act of polluting SAR images or creating deceptive scenes in SAR images through some technical means. **SAR anti-jamming** or **anti-interference** refers to designing a new radar system to prevent jamming signals from entering the receiver, or to remove jamming or interference signals from the received echo. Some publications are listed below.
